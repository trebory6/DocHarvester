Filter API Reference
This page covers the technical details of using Vikunja’s filter syntax through the API. For an introduction to filters and how to use them in the web UI, see the Filters help page.
Query parameters#
Filters are passed as query parameters when listing tasks. The key parameters are:
| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
filter | The filter query string (e.g., done = false && priority >= 3 ) |
filter\_include\_nulls | When true , includes tasks where the filtered field has no value set. Default: false . |
filter\_timezone | Timezone for resolving relative date expressions like now . Uses the server timezone if unset. |
s | Simple text search across task titles and descriptions. Cannot be combined with filter . |
sort\_by | Field(s) to sort by (comma-separated). Options: id , title , done , done\_at , due\_date , start\_date , end\_date , priority , percent\_done , created , updated , position . |
order\_by | Sort direction(s) for each sort\_by field: asc or desc . |
per\_page | Number of results per page. |
Example API request#
GET /api/v1/projects/1/views/5/tasks?filter=due\_date%20%3C%20now%20%26%26%20done%20%3D%20false&sort\_by=priority&order\_by=desc
Field names#
API filter queries use snake\_case
field names, unlike the camelCase
used in the web UI:
| Web UI field | API field |
|---|---|
dueDate | due\_date |
startDate | start\_date |
endDate | end\_date |
doneAt | done\_at |
percentDone | percent\_done |
done | done |
priority | priority |
assignees | assignees |
labels | labels |
project | project |
reminders | reminders |
created | created |
updated | updated |
Labels and projects by ID#
In the web UI, you can refer to labels and projects by name. Through the API, you must use numeric IDs:
labels in 1, 5
project = 12
To look up label IDs, use GET /api/v1/labels
. To look up project IDs, use GET /api/v1/projects
.
Date math#
Date math expressions work the same way in the API as in the web UI. They are resolved server-side when the filter is applied.
Each expression starts with an anchor date (now
or a fixed date ending with ||
), followed by optional arithmetic:
now+7d
— seven days from nownow/d
— start of today (rounded down)now-1M/M
— start of last month2024-03-11||+1w
— one week after March 11, 2024
The syntax is similar to the date math used by Grafana and Elasticsearch.
Time units#
| Unit | Meaning |
|---|---|
s | Seconds |
m | Minutes |
h | Hours |
d | Days |
w | Weeks |
M | Months |
y | Years |
Saved filters API#
Saved filters are managed through these endpoints:
GET /api/v1/filters
— List all saved filtersPUT /api/v1/filters
— Create a saved filterGET /api/v1/filters/{id}
— Get a specific saved filterPOST /api/v1/filters/{id}
— Update a saved filterDELETE /api/v1/filters/{id}
— Delete a saved filter
A saved filter object contains:
{
"id": 1,
"title": "My urgent tasks",
"description": "",
"filters": {
"sort\_by": ["due\_date"],
"order\_by": ["asc"],
"filter": "priority >= 3 && done = false",
"filter\_include\_nulls": false
},
"is\_favorite": false,
"created": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
"updated": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
Saved filters appear in task listing responses as pseudo-projects with negative IDs (e.g., project ID -1
corresponds to saved filter ID 1
).
