Plugins
The plugin system allows you to extend the core functionality with custom features through Go plugins. This guide covers how to install, configure, and use plugins as a Vikunja system admin.
Experimental Feature: The plugin system is still experimental and the API may change in future versions. Additionally, plugins currently only support backend functionality - there is no frontend plugin support yet.
Overview#
Plugins in Vikunja can:
- Add new API endpoints
- Listen to system events
- Run database migrations
- Extend core functionality without modifying Vikunja’s source code
Vikunja supports two plugin loaders:
- Yaegi (recommended): Loads plugins from Go source files. No compilation step needed — just drop
.go
source files into a directory and Vikunja interprets them at runtime using Yaegi. Works on all platforms including Windows. - Native (deprecated): Loads compiled Go shared libraries (
.so
files). Requires exact Go version and dependency matching. Only works on Linux and macOS.
Yaegi plugin support is only available from Vikunja 2.3.0 onwards. The native loader is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

Installation and Configuration#
1. Enable Plugin Support#
Plugins are disabled by default and require enabling in your Vikunja configuration:
plugins:
enabled: true
dir: "plugins" # Directory containing plugins (relative to Vikunja binary)
loader: yaegi # "yaegi" (recommended) or "native" (deprecated)
You can also use an absolute path:
plugins:
enabled: true
dir: "/path/to/your/plugins"
loader: yaegi
The plugins.loader
value is validated at startup — invalid values cause a fatal error.
2. Plugin Directory Structure#
The directory structure depends on which loader you use.
Yaegi Loader#
Each plugin is a subdirectory containing .go
source files:
vikunja/
├── vikunja # Main binary
├── config.yml # Configuration file
└── plugins/ # Plugin directory
├── webhook-plugin/
│ └── main.go
└── analytics/
└── main.go
Native Loader (Deprecated)#
Each plugin is a compiled .so
file:
vikunja/
├── vikunja # Main binary
├── config.yml # Configuration file
└── plugins/ # Plugin directory
├── webhook-plugin.so
└── analytics.so
3. Restart Vikunja#
After adding plugins and updating configuration:
# Using systemd
sudo systemctl restart vikunja
# Or with docker
docker restart 
Plugin Distribution#
Yaegi Plugins#
Yaegi plugins are distributed as Go source files. Since they are interpreted at runtime, there are no compilation or version-matching requirements. Simply copy the plugin source directory into your plugins folder.
Native Plugins (Deprecated)#
Native plugins must be compiled with the exact same Go version as your Vikunja binary. Mismatched versions will cause loading failures.
- Check your Vikunja Go version: Look at build info or release notes
- Ensure plugin
.so
files match this version - Plugins compiled for different architectures (amd64, arm64) won’t work
- Native plugins are only supported on Linux or macOS systems
Managing Plugins#
Installing a Plugin#
Yaegi plugins:
- Copy the plugin source directory to your configured plugins directory
- Restart Vikunja
- Verify in the logs if the plugin has been loaded successfully
Native plugins (deprecated):
- Download the
.so
file for your architecture and Go version - Copy to your configured plugins directory:
cp my-plugin.so /path/to/vikunja/plugins/
- Restart Vikunja
- Verify in the logs if the plugin has been loaded successfully
Removing a Plugin#
- Stop Vikunja
- Delete the plugin directory (yaegi) or
.so
file (native) from the plugins directory - Restart Vikunja
Plugin Status#
Check Vikunja logs during startup to see loaded plugins:
# View recent logs
journalctl -u vikunja -n 50
# Or if running directly
tail -f vikunja.log
# Or with docker
docker logs 
Successful plugin loading shows:
INFO Loaded plugin example-plugin
INFO example-plugin initialized
Using Plugin Features#
API Endpoints#
Plugins can add new API endpoints. Authenticated routes are available under /api/v1/plugins/
, unauthenticated routes under /plugins/
.
Authenticated Endpoints#
Require valid JWT token or API key:
# Example: Get user profile from auth plugin
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR\_JWT\_TOKEN" \
https://your-vikunja.com/api/v1/plugins/user-profile
Public Endpoints#
No authentication required (rate-limited):
# Example: Webhook endpoint
curl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"event": "test"}' \
https://your-vikunja.com/plugins/webhook
Database Changes#
Some plugins run database migrations to add new tables or modify existing ones. These run automatically when:
- Plugin is first loaded
- Plugin version is upgraded
- Vikunja starts with plugin enabled
Troubleshooting#
Plugin Won’t Load#
Error: Failed to load plugin example-plugin.so: plugin.Open("example-plugin"): plugin was built with a different version of package X
Solution: Plugin was compiled with different Go version than Vikunja. Get a compatible version, recompile, or switch to the yaegi loader.
Error: invalid plugin entry point
Solution: Plugin doesn’t export required NewPlugin()
function. Contact plugin developer.
Plugin Loads But Doesn’t Work#
Check logs for plugin-specific errors:
grep "plugin-name" /var/log/vikunja.log
Common issues:
- Plugin configuration missing or incorrect
- Database migration failures
- Permission issues with plugin files
- Missing dependencies
Routes Not Available#
Issue: Plugin API endpoints return 404
Solutions:
- Check if plugin initialization succeeded
- Ensure Vikunja was restarted after adding plugin
- Test with curl or API client to confirm route registration
Security Considerations#
Plugin Trust#
- Only install plugins from trusted sources
- Plugins run with full Vikunja permissions
- Malicious plugins can access your database and user data
- Review plugin source code before installing — yaegi plugins make this easy since they are plain Go source files
File Permissions#
Ensure proper permissions on plugin files:
# Plugin files should be readable by Vikunja user
chmod -R 644 /path/to/plugins/
chown -R vikunja:vikunja /path/to/plugins/
Network Access#
Plugins can make network requests. Consider:
- Firewall rules for plugin network access
- Monitoring outbound connections
- Reviewing plugin network usage
Known Limitations#
- No Plugin Unloading: Once loaded, plugins cannot be unloaded without restarting Vikunja
- Yaegi: Single-file plugins only (for now): The yaegi loader evaluates
.go
files individually, so multi-file plugins may hit order-dependency issues - Yaegi: Interpreted performance: Yaegi plugins run interpreted, not compiled. This is fine for hooks and route handlers but would be a concern for hot-path code
- Native: Version Sensitivity: Exact Go version match required between plugin and Vikunja
- Native: Platform Specific: Native plugins only work on Linux and macOS
- Memory Sharing: Plugins share the same memory space as Vikunja
Best Practices#
- Test thoroughly in development environment first
- Backup database before installing plugins with migrations
- Monitor resource usage after adding new plugins
- Keep plugins updated with Vikunja version upgrades
- Document plugin purposes for team members
- Prefer yaegi plugins for easier distribution and cross-platform support
