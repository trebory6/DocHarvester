Migration from third-party services
There are several importers available for third-party services like Trello, Microsoft To Do or Todoist.
Setup#
To set up migration, check out the config docs.
Prerequisites#
Several migration sources (Trello, Todoist, Microsoft To Do) use OAuth for authentication. The OAuth redirect happens in your browser, so your Vikunja instance does not need to be publicly accessible from the internet — it only needs to be reachable from the browser you’re using to perform the migration.
However, the VIKUNJA\_SERVICE\_PUBLICURL
must be set correctly so that the OAuth redirect URL points to where your browser can reach Vikunja.
Supported migration sources#
| Source | Method |
|---|---|
| Todoist | OAuth |
| Trello | OAuth |
| Microsoft To Do | OAuth |
| TickTick | File import |
| WeKan | File import |
| Vikunja (file export) | File import |
If your source service is not listed, you may be able to export data as CSV or JSON and convert it to Vikunja’s import format. See the development docs for writing custom importers.
Start the Migration Process#
Log in, and navigate to Settings > Import from other services. In the list of available third-party services, there should be an icon for each of the enabled services. If not, ensure that the config options are properly picked up. Refer to the Vikunja log to see if the config file was loaded or not. If there is no icon for the service you enabled, make sure your config setup is correct.
Click on the service icon and on Get Started. This will redirect you to the service where you need to allow Vikunja Migration to access your account. In case there is an error when being redirected, make sure that you allowed your Vikunja domain in the allowed redirects or origin list in the service. Once this is done, you will be redirected to Vikunja which should tell you that the migration is in progress now. It can take up to several hours depending on the amount of boards in your account.
Adding new migration options#
You can develop migrations for more services, see the documentation for more info.
