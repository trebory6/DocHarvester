Security#
Vikunja recognizes the importance of excellent security practices. While we are a small team focused on providing efficient task and project organization, we work hard to ensure top-notch security for all our users. We understand that project management often involves sensitive information, and we are committed to protecting your data with the utmost care.
This document covers our security practices and policies. If you are interested in the data we collect and store, please refer to our privacy policy.
General practices#
- Access to production servers, source code repositories, and integrated third-party services is secured with two-factor authentication.
- We implement strong, randomly-generated passwords that are unique to each system and user.
- Vikunja team members and contractors are granted the minimum level of access required to perform their duties. This typically excludes direct access to production systems or user data.
- We employ automated security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in our codebase and dependencies. We prioritize rapid application of security patches and swift deployment of updates.
- We don’t copy production data to external devices (like personal laptops).
Vikunja Cloud Hosting#
All parts of Vikunja Cloud are hosted at Hetzner in Germany and Finland. Their data centers are kept secure through multiple layers of physical, network and system security and their ISO/IEC 27001 certification.
