Webhooks
Send automatic notifications to external services when tasks are created, completed, or changed.
Webhooks let Vikunja send automatic notifications to other services whenever something happens in your projects, like when a task is created, completed, or commented on. This is useful for connecting Vikunja to chat tools, automation platforms, or custom scripts.
Types of webhooks#
Vikunja has two types of webhooks:
- Project webhooks: Trigger when something happens in a specific project (e.g., a task is created or a comment is added). Set these up from the project settings.
- User webhooks: Trigger for events directed at you personally, such as task reminders firing or tasks becoming overdue. Set these up from your account settings.
Creating a webhook#
Project webhooks#
- Open the project where you want the webhook.
- Go to the project settings and select Webhooks.
- Fill in the form:
- Target URL (required): The URL that Vikunja will send data to (must start with
http://
orhttps://
). - Events (required): Choose which events should trigger the webhook.
- Secret (optional): A shared secret for verifying that requests really come from Vikunja. See Signing below.
- Basic Auth (optional): Click Use Basic Auth? to enter a username and password if the target URL requires it.
- Target URL (required): The URL that Vikunja will send data to (must start with
- Click Save.
User webhooks#
- Open your Settings and go to the Webhooks section.
- Fill in the same form as above. User webhooks only allow user-directed events (reminders and overdue notifications).
Available events#
Project events#
These events are available for project webhooks:
task.created | A task was created |
task.updated | A task was updated |
task.deleted | A task was deleted |

task.assignee.deleted | An assignee was removed from a task |

User events#
These events are available for user webhooks:

task.overdue | A task became overdue |
tasks.overdue | Multiple tasks became overdue |
Editing and deleting webhooks#
To edit or delete a webhook, go to the same settings page where you created it (project settings for project webhooks, account settings for user webhooks). Your existing webhooks are listed there with options to modify or remove them.
Signing#
If you set a secret when creating the webhook, Vikunja includes an X-Vikunja-Signature
header in every request. This header contains an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the request body, which lets the receiving service verify that the request genuinely came from Vikunja.
See webhooks.fyi for details on how to validate HMAC signatures.
Payload format#
Every webhook request sends a JSON body with this structure:
{
"event\_name": "task.created",
"time": "2023-10-17T19:39:32.924194436+02:00",
"data": {}
}
event\_name
: Which event triggered the webhook.time
: When the webhook was sent, in ISO 8601 format.data
: The event data, containing the relevant objects (task, project, user, etc.) depending on the event type.
API reference#
To create and manage webhooks programmatically, see the Webhooks API Reference. You can create API tokens in your settings to authenticate with the API.
Notes#
- Webhooks are sent once. If delivery fails (e.g., the target URL is unreachable), Vikunja does not retry.
- Webhooks cannot be created via link shares. You need a user account.
- Instance administrators can configure webhook timeouts and proxy settings. See the webhook configuration options for details.
