Tasks
Everything about tasks: the detail view, descriptions, labels, priorities, assignees, comments, checklists, and more.
Tasks are the core building blocks in Vikunja. Every to-do item, action item, or piece of work lives as a task inside a project.
Quick reference#
- Open a task: Click it in any view. In Gantt, double-click.
- Create a task: Use the input at the top of the list view or on the dashboard.
- Set details while typing: Use Quick Add Magic for dates, labels, priorities, and more.
- Move a task: Change its project in the detail view, or drag it to another project from list and Kanban views.
Opening a task#
Click any task in the list, Kanban, or table view to open the task detail view. In the Gantt view, double-click the task instead.
The detail view is where you edit the task title, description, dates, labels, assignees, attachments, and everything else.
Title#
The task title is displayed at the top of the detail view. Click on it to edit it inline.
Description#
Below the title is the description editor. If the task does not have a description yet, the editor opens in edit mode so you can start typing immediately.
The editor supports standard rich-text formatting such as headings, bold, italic, and lists. Markdown shortcuts also work, and pasted Markdown is converted automatically.
You can upload attachments directly in the editor by dragging in a file or using the upload button.
Right sidebar#
The right sidebar holds the task properties and actions.
Marking a task as done#
Click the Done button at the top of the right sidebar to mark the task as completed. Click it again to reopen the task.
Subscribing to a task#
Click Subscribe to follow changes on the task. Subscribers receive notifications for comments, edits, and triggered reminders.
You are always subscribed if you created the task.
Favoriting a task#
Click Favorite to add the task to the Favorites project in the sidebar. This is useful for tasks you need to return to often.
Duplicating a task#
Click Duplicate in the right sidebar to create a copy of the task. The duplicate includes all properties: labels, assignees, attachments, relations, and the cover image.
Labels#
Labels help you categorize tasks and build filters later.
Click the labels field in the right sidebar to search for and add existing labels, or create new ones on the fly.
See Labels for more details on creating and managing labels.
Priority#
Set a priority from Unset to Do Now.
You can also use priority in filters.
Progress#
Set a percentage between 0 and 100 to track progress manually.
Color#
Assign a color to make the task stand out, especially in Kanban and Gantt views.
Assignees#
Assign one or more users who are responsible for completing the task.
Only users who already have access to the project can be assigned to a task. See Sharing & Teams for how to give users access.
Dates#
A task can have a start date, end date, and due date. See Dates & Reminders for details.
Attachments#
Click Attachments in the sidebar (or press f
) to open the file picker and upload files. You can also drag files into the description editor.
Clicking an uploaded attachment opens a preview where possible:
- Images (
jpg
,jpeg
,png
,gif
,bmp
) open inline in a modal. - PDFs open inline in a modal using your browser’s built-in PDF viewer, so you can scroll, zoom, and search without leaving the task. PDF previews are available from Vikunja 2.3.0 onwards.
- Other file types download directly.
A separate download button next to each attachment always downloads the file, regardless of whether it has a preview.
Relations#
Use relations to link tasks together, for example as subtasks, parent tasks, blockers, or related work.
Click Add a relation, find the other task, then choose the relation type.
See Task Relations for the full list of available relation types and how to use them.
Moving a task#
You can move a task to another project in two ways:
- From the detail view: Use the project field in the right sidebar to select a different project.
- From the list or Kanban view: Drag the task onto another project in the sidebar.
Changing the Kanban bucket#
If the task’s project has a manual Kanban view, the detail view shows a small bucket picker next to the project name, just below the task title. Click it to move the task to a different bucket without leaving the detail view.
Changing the bucket this way has the same effect as dragging the task on the Kanban board: moving it into the done bucket marks the task as done, and moving it back out marks it as not done.
The picker only appears for projects that have a regular Kanban view with manually managed buckets. Projects that use filter-based buckets do not show the picker because bucket membership is controlled by filters there.
Comments#
Comments are shown below the task description and use the same editor.
You can mention other users by typing @
followed by their username. Mentioned users will receive a notification.
You can switch comment order between oldest-first and newest-first once the task has comments.
Checklists#
Use the checkbox list option in the description editor to create a checklist.
Checklist progress appears on the task card in the list view, so you can see completion at a glance.
Quick Add Magic#
You can set dates, labels, priorities, assignees, and more while typing a task title. See Quick Add Magic for the full syntax.
Hover preview#
In the list view, hovering over a task opens a small preview with the title, description, creator, labels, and other key details.
