Views
Configure how tasks are displayed: List, Table, Gantt, and Kanban views, each with optional filters.
Views control how tasks are shown inside a project. Every project starts with four default views, and you switch between them using the tabs at the top of the project.
Which view should I use?#
| View | Best for | Key feature |
|---|---|---|
| List | Simple task lists, quick entry | Drag to reorder, Quick Add Magic |
| Table | Comparing many task attributes | Configurable columns, spreadsheet-like |
| Kanban | Workflow stages (To Do / In Progress / Done) | Drag tasks between buckets |
| Gantt | Scheduling by date | Timeline with drag-to-reschedule |
You can choose the default project view in your user settings.
Overdue tasks are highlighted across all views so you can spot them at a glance.
Managing views#
To manage views, open the three-dot menu next to the project title and select Views.
From here you can:
- Create a new view: Give it a title, choose the type (list, table, kanban), and optionally set a filter.
- Edit a view: Change its title, type, or filter.
- Delete a view: Remove views you no longer need.
- Reorder views: Drag and drop using the handle on the right side of each view in the list.
Each view can have its own filter. Only matching tasks appear in that view. See Filters for the filter syntax.
List view#
The list view shows tasks in a flat list. It is the simplest view and a good default for most projects.
- Drag and drop tasks to reorder them within the project.
- Move tasks to another project by dragging them onto a project in the sidebar.
- Hover over a task to see a preview with the title, description, creator, and labels.
- Quick-add input at the top lets you create tasks and use Quick Add Magic.
By default, done tasks are hidden in the list view. You can change that by editing the view filter.
Sorting the list#
Click the sort button in the list header to change how tasks are ordered. You can sort by:
- Manually (the default, which lets you drag and drop tasks into any order)
- Title, A to Z or Z to A
- Due date, start date, or end date, earliest or latest first
- Priority, highest or lowest first
- % done, most or least done first
- Created or updated, newest or oldest first
The list view sorts by one field at a time. Your choice is stored in the URL, so you can bookmark a list with a specific sort order or share the link with someone else.
Sorting was added in Vikunja 2.3.0. In the table view, you can still sort by clicking column headers directly, and hold Ctrl
or Cmd
to sort by more than one column at once.
Gantt view#
The Gantt view places tasks on a timeline using their start and end dates. Use it when scheduling matters more than a simple list.
- Set the date range with the controls in the top left.
- Subtask hierarchy: Subtasks are grouped under their parent task. Collapse or expand groups to control how much detail you see. Parent tasks display a summary bar with diamond endpoints spanning the range of their children.
- Dependency arrows: Relations between tasks are shown as arrows on the chart. The arrows update in real time when you drag or resize a task.
- Partial dates: Tasks that only have a start date or only an end date are shown with a gradient fade on the open-ended side.
- Adjust dates visually: Drag a task on the timeline to change its start and end dates.
- Open task details: Double-click a task on the timeline to open its full detail view.
- Create tasks from the input at the bottom left.
Filtering is not available in the Gantt view.
Table view#
The table view shows tasks in a spreadsheet-like layout.
- Configurable columns: Show only the fields you care about.
- Filtering: Use the filter option in the top right to narrow down the displayed tasks.
Use table view when you want to compare many task fields side by side.
Kanban view#
The Kanban view organizes tasks into buckets. It works well for workflows such as To Do, Doing, and Done.
Working with tasks#
- Drag and drop tasks between buckets to change their status.
- Click a card to open the full task detail view.
- Task cards show details such as color, due date, comment count, labels, and other status icons.
Managing buckets#
To create a bucket, enter a title in the field at the far right of the board. To rename one, click its title and edit it inline.
Each bucket has a three-dot menu where you can set a WIP limit, mark it as the default or done bucket, collapse it, or delete it.
You can reorder buckets by dragging and dropping them by their header.
Deleting a bucket#
When you delete a bucket, its tasks are moved to the default bucket. You cannot delete the last bucket in a Kanban view.
WIP limits#
You can set a work-in-progress (WIP) limit to cap how many tasks a bucket should hold.
When a bucket reaches its limit:
- The task count in the header turns red
- The “Add a task” button is disabled
- Tasks cannot be dragged in from other buckets
Tasks can still be dragged out of a full bucket or reordered inside it.
The bucket header shows the current task count alongside the limit (for example, “5/10”). You can enable an option in your user settings to always show the task count on buckets, even when no limit is set.
Default bucket#
The default bucket is where new tasks go when they are created without a specific bucket, for example from the list or table view. It is also where tasks go if their current bucket is deleted.
If no default bucket is explicitly set, the first bucket is used.
Done bucket#
Marking a bucket as the “done bucket” links that bucket to task completion:
- When a task is dragged into the done bucket, it is automatically marked as done.
- When a task is marked as done from anywhere else (for example, by checking it off in the list view), it is automatically moved into the done bucket.
- When a task in the done bucket is marked as not done, it is moved back to the default bucket.
Collapsing buckets#
Collapse a bucket to hide its contents and save space. Click it again to expand it. The collapsed state is saved in your browser.
Cover images#
You can add a cover image to a task card:
- Upload an image as an attachment on the task.
- Click the icon on the attachment to set it as the cover image.
The image will appear on the Kanban card.
Filter-based buckets#
Kanban buckets can work in two ways:
- Manual bucket management (default): You move tasks yourself.
- Filter-based buckets: Buckets are filled automatically from filter queries. In this mode, tasks cannot be dragged between buckets.
Saved filters vs. views#
Vikunja has two different ways to change how tasks appear:
- Views are per-project display configurations. They determine how tasks in a specific project are shown and can be shared with everyone who has access to the project.
- Saved Filters are personal, cross-project filter queries. They appear in your sidebar and let you create custom filtered lists across all your projects using the filter syntax. Saved Filters cannot be shared with other users.
See Saved Filters for full details on creating and managing them.
