Saved Filters
Saved filters are personal, cross-project task views built from filter queries.
Saved filters let you create personal, cross-project task views based on a filter query. Unlike views, which are tied to a single project and shared with its members, saved filters are private to your account and pull tasks from all your projects at once.
This makes them useful for things like “all high-priority tasks across every project” or “tasks assigned to me that are due this week.”
Creating a saved filter#
To create a saved filter, go to the project overview page and click New saved filter. You will be prompted to fill in the following:
- Title (required): a name for the filter, up to 250 characters
- Description (optional): a longer explanation of what the filter is for, with rich text formatting
- Filter query: the filter expression that determines which tasks are shown
The filter query uses the same syntax as project view filters. You can use all available filter fields, including the project
field, which is only available in saved filters and lets you limit results to specific projects.
The default filter for new saved filters is done = false
, which shows only incomplete tasks.
Editing a saved filter#
To edit a saved filter, open it from the sidebar, then click the three-dot menu next to its title and select Edit. You can change the title, description, and filter query.
Deleting a saved filter#
Open the filter’s edit page and click Delete at the bottom. You will be asked to confirm before the filter is removed.
Sidebar and navigation#
Saved filters appear in the left sidebar alongside your projects, marked with a filter icon. You can also find them through the quick actions menu (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K on macOS).
Views within saved filters#
Each saved filter automatically gets multiple views, just like a regular project. You can switch between List, Gantt, Table, and Kanban views using the tabs at the top.
When using the Kanban view on a saved filter, you can create and manage buckets the same way as in a regular project. Vikunja automatically keeps the kanban board in sync with the filter: tasks that start matching the filter are added to the default bucket, and tasks that no longer match are removed.
Favorites#
You can mark a saved filter as a favorite by clicking the star icon next to its title in the sidebar. Favorited filters appear in the Favorites section at the top of the sidebar for quick access.
Using saved filters on the dashboard#
You can use a saved filter to customize which tasks appear on your dashboard. To do this:
- Create a saved filter with the query you want.
- Open your Settings and set the filter as the home screen filter.
This is useful if you only want to see specific tasks when you log in, rather than everything from all projects.
Limitations#
- Saved filters are personal: only you can see and edit your saved filters. They cannot be shared with other users, teams, or via link shares.
- Saved filters are not available via link shares at all.
