Quick Add Magic
Create tasks faster by typing labels, dates, priorities, and more directly into the task title.
Quick Add Magic lets you set task details like due dates, labels, and priorities while typing the task title. Instead of creating a task and then editing its fields one by one, you can do it all in one step.
For example, typing:
Order packing supplies \*logistics !3 tomorrow at 5pm
creates a task called “Order packing supplies” with the label logistics
, priority 3, and a due date of tomorrow at 5pm.
Quick Add Magic is available in the web UI. It uses the default mode described below. If you’re coming from Todoist, you can switch to Todoist-compatible shortcuts in your settings.
Labels#
Add a label by typing \*
followed by the label name. If the label doesn’t exist yet, Vikunja creates it for you.
\*logistics
adds the label “logistics”\*"waiting on others"
wraps the name in quotes for multi-word labels- You can add multiple labels:
\*urgent \*logistics
Assignees#
Assign the task to someone by typing @
followed by their username. You can assign multiple people.
@sarah
assigns the task to sarah@sarah @david
assigns to both
Project#
Move the task into a specific project by typing +
followed by the project name. The project must already exist.
+Personal
puts the task in the “Personal” project+"Office Move"
wraps the name in quotes for multi-word projects
Priority#
Set a priority by typing !
followed by a number from 1 (low) to 5 (urgent).
!1
low priority!5
urgent
Dates and times#
Type a date anywhere in the task title to set it as the due date. Vikunja understands many natural formats:
- Relative: today, tonight, tomorrow, next monday, this weekend, later this week, next week, next month, end of month, in 5 days
- Weekdays: tuesday (uses the next occurrence)
- Specific dates: 17/02/2025, Feb 17, 17th (current month)
Add a time with at
: tomorrow at 5pm
, next monday at 17:00
.
Repeating tasks#
Make a task repeat by adding every
followed by an interval:
every day
every 3 days
every week
every 2 weeks
every month
Creating multiple tasks at once#
To create several tasks in one go, enter each task on its own line. Press Shift + Enter
to add a new line, or paste multiline text from another document.
Subtasks#
When entering multiple tasks, indent a line to make it a subtask of the line above. You can use spaces or tabs for indentation, just be consistent within one batch.
Plan moving day
Reserve loading dock
Notify all departments
Print department labels
This creates “Plan moving day” as the parent task, with “Reserve loading dock” and “Notify all departments” as subtasks. “Print department labels” becomes a subtask of “Notify all departments”.
Putting it all together#
Moving check-in +"Office Move" \*urgent every week monday at 10am
Creates a repeating weekly task called “Moving check-in” in the “Office Move” project, labeled “urgent”, due every Monday at 10am.
Finalize seating chart \*urgent \*logistics @david in 5 days
Creates a task assigned to david, with two labels, due in 5 days.
Todoist mode#
If you’re used to Todoist’s quick-add shortcuts, you can switch Vikunja to use those keywords instead.
Go to Settings, scroll to “Quick Add Magic Mode”, and select “Todoist”.
Skipping parsing#
If your task title contains words that Quick Add Magic would normally interpret (like “tomorrow” or “monday”), wrap the entire title in quotes to disable parsing:
"Buy milk tomorrow"
This creates a task with the literal title “Buy milk tomorrow” without setting a due date.
