Task Relations
Link tasks together with relations like subtask, blocking, related, and more.
Task relations let you create links between tasks to express dependencies, hierarchies, or other connections. You can add relations from the right sidebar of the task detail view.
Adding a relation#
- Open a task and scroll to the Relations section in the right sidebar.
- Click Add a relation.
- Search for the task you want to link to.
- Choose the relation type from the dropdown.
The relation is applied immediately. The linked task will show the opposite relation automatically. For example, if you mark “Order new furniture” as blocking “Set up meeting rooms”, “Set up meeting rooms” will show that it is blocked by “Order new furniture”.
Removing a relation#
To remove an existing relation, open the task detail view and click the remove button next to the relation you want to delete.
Default relation type#
When adding a relation, Vikunja uses a default relation type. You can change this default in Settings → General → Default task relation type.
