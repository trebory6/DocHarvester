Webhooks API
This page covers the technical details of working with Vikunja webhooks programmatically. For an introduction to what webhooks are and how to set them up in the UI, see the Webhooks help page.
API endpoints#
You can create and manage webhooks through the API. Full endpoint documentation is available in the Swagger docs.
Project webhooks#
GET /api/v1/projects/{id}/webhooks
— List all webhooks for a projectPUT /api/v1/projects/{id}/webhooks
— Create a webhook for a projectDELETE /api/v1/projects/{id}/webhooks/{webhookID}
— Delete a webhookPOST /api/v1/projects/{id}/webhooks/{webhookID}
— Update a webhook
User webhooks#
GET /api/v1/user/settings/webhooks
— List all webhooks for the current userPUT /api/v1/user/settings/webhooks
— Create a user webhookDELETE /api/v1/user/settings/webhooks/{webhookID}
— Delete a user webhookPOST /api/v1/user/settings/webhooks/{webhookID}
— Update a user webhook
Authenticate with an API token or JWT. Link share tokens cannot create or manage webhooks.
Payload structure#
Every webhook delivery sends a POST
request with a JSON body:
{
"event\_name": "task.created",
"time": "2023-10-17T19:39:32.924194436+02:00",
"data": {
"task": { ... },
"doer": { ... }
}
}
| Field | Description |
|---|---|
event\_name | The event that triggered the webhook (e.g., task.created ) |
time | ISO 8601 timestamp with timezone offset |
data | Event-specific payload containing the relevant objects (task, project, etc.) |
The contents of data
depend on the event type. Task events include the full task object and the user who performed the action (doer
). Comment, attachment, and relation events include the relevant sub-object as well.
Signature verification#
If you set a secret when creating the webhook, Vikunja signs every outgoing request. The signature is sent in the X-Vikunja-Signature
HTTP header as an HMAC-SHA256 hash of the raw JSON request body.
To verify a webhook delivery:
- Read the raw request body (before parsing JSON).
- Compute the HMAC-SHA256 of the body using your secret as the key.
- Compare your computed signature with the value of
X-Vikunja-Signature
.
See webhooks.fyi for detailed implementation examples in various languages.
Hosting security#
If your Vikunja instance is used by multiple people, outgoing webhook requests could be used to probe internal network services (SSRF). Vikunja supports using mole as a proxy for outgoing webhook requests to prevent this.
Configure the proxy in your Vikunja config:
webhooks:
proxyurl: "http://mole:8080"
proxypassword: "your-proxy-password"
See the webhook configuration options for all available settings, including timeout configuration.
See webhooks.fyi for more on why egress security matters.
Delivery behavior#
- Webhooks are delivered once. Failed deliveries (HTTP status >= 400 or timeout) are not retried.
- The default timeout for webhook delivery is 30 seconds, configurable via
webhooks.timeoutseconds
. - Webhooks must be enabled globally via the
webhooks.enabled
config option (enabled by default).
